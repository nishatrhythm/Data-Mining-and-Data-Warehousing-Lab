### 1. Diabetes Dataset
The goal of this task is to predict diabetes based on medical predictor variables.

#### Tasks:
- **a)** Display patient information using a pie chart.
- **b)** Handle missing values using mean for one column, median for another, and mode for a third.
- **c)** Plot a boxplot of the pre-processed dataset.
- **d)** Compare the performance of machine learning models like Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT).
- **e)** Display the confusion matrix of the models' results.

### 2. Petrol Consumption Dataset
This task involves predicting fuel consumption based on various features.

#### Tasks:
- **a)** Predict fuel consumption using multiple linear regression.
- **b)** Compare results using 70:30 and 80:20 data splits for training.
- **c)** Show the actual and predicted values in a scatter plot for the 80:20 split.
- **d)** Calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the predictions.

### 3. Mall Customers Dataset
This task focuses on customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

#### Tasks:
- **a)** Visualize the male and female customer spending scores.
- **b)** Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
- **c)** Apply k-means clustering with 4 and 5 clusters.
- **d)** Visualize the clustering results graphically.
